A student registration form, built with HTML, captures essential details like name, email, gender, and skills selection (HTML, CSS, JS). With JavaScript handling form submission, data validation and processing occur instantly, avoiding page reloads. The output is dynamically showcased below the form, presenting the registered student's information, creating a seamless and interactive user experience.
